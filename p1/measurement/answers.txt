Q2.
The expected latency and throughput is 160ms and 20Mbps.

The average RTT is 161.539ms and measured throughput is 18.609 Mbps

The total latency from h1 to h4 should be sum of latency of L1, L2, L3, which is
80 + 20 + 60 = 160ms. The throughput cannot exceed the minimum throughput of L1,
L2, L3, which is 20Mbps.

Q3.
For two pairs, the expected latency is still 160ms, but the expected throughput
of each pair should roughly be 10Mbps(half of 20Mbps).
For three pairs, the expected latency is still 160ms, but the throughput of eac
pair should roughly be 6.67Mbps(one-third of 20Mbps).

For two pairs, the average RTT is 161.580 and 161.328ms, and measured
throughput is 12.037 and 6.876 Mbps.
For three pairs, the average RTT is 161.347, 162.418, and 161.525ms, and the
measured throughput is 10.991, 4.923, and 3.804Mbps.

The latency is still the same because even though there are more than one pair
of hosts using the same link path at the same time, none of the factors of
latency (propagation, transmit, queue) changes significantly. The queuing time
does not change significantly because the ping command waits one seconds betwee
sending each package.

The bandwith are not shared equally between those pairs of hosts could be a
result of not being able to start all the clients at the same time (need time to
switch between xterm windows and hit enter to run the clients).

Q4.
For h1-h4 and h5-h6, the expected latency is 160 and 40ms, and the expected
throughput is 15~20 and 25~20Mbps.

For h1-h4 and h5-h6, the average RTT is 161.414 and 41.341ms, and the measured
throughput is 15.434 and 22.255 Mbps respectively.

The latency does not change for the same reason mentioned in Q3. The throughput 
is 15~20 and 25~20Mbps, bacause:
case 1: h1-h4 have a throughput of 20Mbps, links on h5-h6 have 25, 20, 25Mbps
bandwith, so the h5-h6 can have a throughput of 20Mbps.
case 2: Links on h5-h6 have 25, 40, 25Mbps bandwith, so h5-h6 have a throughput
of 25Mbps. Links on h1-h4 have 20, 15, 30Mbps bandwidth, so h1-h4 can have a
throughput of 15Mbps.
