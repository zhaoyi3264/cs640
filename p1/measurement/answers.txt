Q2.
The expected latency and throughput is 160 ms and 20 Mbps.

The average RTT is 161.058 ms and measured throughput is 18.546 Mbps

The total latency from h1 to h4 should be sum of latency of L1, L2, L3, which is
80 + 20 + 60 = 160 ms. The throughput cannot exceed the minimum throughput of
L1, L2, L3, which is 20 Mbps.

Q3.
For two pairs, the expected latency is still 160 ms, but the expected throughput
of each pair should roughly be 10 Mbps (half of 20 Mbps).
For three pairs, the expected latency is still 160 ms, but the throughput of
each pair should roughly be 6.67 Mbps(one-third of 20 Mbps).

For two pairs, the average RTT is 161.580 and 161.328 ms, and measured
throughput is 11.537 and 7.536 Mbps.
For three pairs, the average RTT is 161.347, 162.418, and 161.525 ms, and the
measured throughput is 8.996, 4.925, and 5.103 Mbps.

The latency is still the same because even though there are more than one pair
of hosts using the same link path at the same time, none of the factors of
latency (propagation, transmit, queue) changes significantly. The queuing time
does not change significantly because the ping command waits one seconds between
sending each package.

The bandwith are not shared equally between those pairs of hosts could be a
result of the clients are not started at exactly the same time, even though a
script is used to start the server and client programs together.

Q4.
For h1-h4 and h5-h6, the expected latency is 160 and 40 ms, and the expected
throughput is 15~20 and 25~20 Mbps.

For h1-h4 and h5-h6, the average RTT is 160.979 and 41.123 ms, and the measured
throughput is 17.628 and 20.240 Mbps respectively.

The latency does not change for the same reason mentioned in Q3. The throughput 
is 15~20 and 25~20 Mbps, bacause:
case 1: h1-h4 have a throughput of 20 Mbps, links on h5-h6 have 25, 20, 25 Mbps
bandwith, so the h5-h6 can have a throughput of 20 Mbps.
case 2: Links on h5-h6 have 25, 40, 25 Mbps bandwith, so h5-h6 have a throughput
of 25 Mbps. Links on h1-h4 have 20, 15, 30 Mbps bandwidth, so h1-h4 can have a
throughput of 15 Mbps.
